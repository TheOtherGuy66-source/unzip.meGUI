# Experimental Python Script

This is an experimental Python script I created to see if I could archive and unarchive stuff. It works alright, I guess, but it's probably not the best thing to use. It will install all the pip modules when it starts.

It could probably be updated, but I just don't really feel the need to do much more to it. It could be included in projects that need to unzip archives on their backend. It could be implemented to run each feature from auto-detecting the archive, then unzipping.
